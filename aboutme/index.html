  <h2> Gustavo Lima de Sousa</h2>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>Hey everyone, you can call me Gustavo. I'm 27, not married yet. My favorite hobbie is to go to the gym. I was a business student at BYU-Idaho until last semester, but I changed my major to Applied Technology. </p>
  <p>What I like the most about BYU-I is that I can study online. As I want to become a web developer this course will help me to build a few bases to my profession. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the most important tools for a web developer.</p>
  <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ my entire life. My favorite quote is this: "If for a while the harder you try, the harder it gets, take heart. So it has been with the best people who ever lived.” ―Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, "The Inconvenient Messiah"</p>
