    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Gustavo Lima de Sousa, I’m 27, and I was born in Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil. My journey with technology started early in my life, when I was 10, my family bought a computer desktop. For me, it was the most exciting experience. I had already seen them at school and other public places, but having a computer at home was a dream coming true.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sooner after getting a computer, my father enrolled me in a course to learn how to handle it. In just a few weeks, I was able to type as fast as my brain could generate the sentences. I also learned to use the revolutionary 2003 Microsoft Office package.
      <br>
      <br>
      My desire to learn more about computers kept growing, and in 2007, I found a school that taught computer maintenance. I still remember how excited I was to start that course. However, registration was only possible if I would choose the pack of two courses. My father was a bit reluctant because they were expensive, but he trusted me and then I also started the web design course.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my teenage years, the website Tumblr was a whole success in Brazil. Almost every teen at my school had a blog. I wasn’t different, I used it all the time. The interesting thing about Tumblr is that we could customize it according to our desire. I remember using and changing all the codes even though I didn’t know what exactly they were at that time.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have never stopped using and playing with computer software during my entire life. But I distanced myself from developing for a few years. I just thought that technology was a hobby and I would just find something else as a career.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 2020, I started Business management at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I was almost sure that that career path was my best choice. However, in 2022, my desire for web design and development started growing again. I bought a course named ORIGAMID and started doing it alongside the university and I just found myself again.
      <br>
      <br>
      In April 2023, I decided to change my business major at the university to a technology major and I just feel that I was born to do that. This is my path.
